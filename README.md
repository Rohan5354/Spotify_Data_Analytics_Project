# Spotify_Data_Analytics_Project
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using SQL. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced).

The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

This project has helped a lot in learning and revising the fundamental cocepts of SQL required to a data analyst.
